# tlottie

Library for drawing [lottie animations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottie_(file_format)), written in Rust.

- Micro-optimized and [benchmarked](#benchmarks) across 17k+ animations from Telegram, against [rlottie](https://github.com/Samsung/rlottie) and [thorvg](https://github.com/thorvg/thorvg).
- SIMD on ARM NEON, x86_64 SSE2 AVX2 AVX512, and WASM: [web demo](https://dkaraush.github.io/tlottie/examples/web/).
- Support of `fitz` modifier and color replacements.
- Support of rendering into only alpha channel bitmap.
- Safe. Lottie JSON is treated as untrusted input.
- Zero[^1] dependencies.

### Building (Native)

```bash
cargo rustc --release --features c-api --lib --crate-type staticlib
# library will be built at target/release/libtlottie.a
# include headers are at include/tlottie.h
```

### Building (Web)

```bash
./examples/web/build.sh
# .wasm will be copied to examples/web/tlottie.wasm
```

Example on how to work with `tlottie.wasm` is at [examples/web/](https://github.com/dkaraush/tlottie/tree/dev/examples/web).
